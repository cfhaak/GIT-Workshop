# Git CLI Cheat Sheet
Here you have nearly everything you need to know about git in the command line. I am ignoring a lot of options and commands, that might be handy too, but after all, this will get you far in the every day usage of git.
Following the unix conventions variables in `<>` need to be replaced by your own values.
Also be careful what you do, some commands are dangerous and will make you loose data! Also note that some commands might not work if you have a very old git version.

Also note: I might be an idiot and produce errors in my examples. I don't take any responsibility for demaged systems, lost data etc. 
Please report any issues you might encounter.

## Cloning/Initializing a Repository

  ### Clone a repository
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```

  ### Clone a bare repository (without remot ref)
  ```bash
  git clone --bare <repository-url>
  ```

  ### Initialize a new repository and push to remote
  ```bash
  git init
  git add --all
  git commit -m "Initial project version"
  git remote add origin <url>
  git push -u origin main
  ```

## Creating/Removing/Switching Branches
  ### Create a branch
  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  git push -u <origin> <branch-name>
  ```

  ### Switch to a branch
  ```bash
  git switch <branch-name>
  ```

  ### Delete a branch locally
  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```

  ### Delete a branch remotely
  ```bash
  git push -d <origin> <branch-name>
  ```

## Merging Branches
  ### Merge a branch into the current branch
  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

  ### Abort a merge
  ```bash
  git merge --abort
  ```

## Adding/Commiting/Updating

  ### Stage changes
  ```bash

  git commit --amend
  # if not, just push
  git push


  ```

  ### See remote updates without merging

  git fetch
  ```

## Undo Changes

  ### Unstage a file

  git restore --staged <file-name>
  ```

  ### Undo last commit but keep changes

  ```

  ### (careful!) Deletes unstaged changes in tracked files

  ### Revert a commit & create new commit (dangerous!)
  ```bash
  git revert <commit-reference>
  ```

## Stashing
  ### Stash current changes in tracked files (it's like saving them in a temp directory)
  ```bash

  ```
  ### List stashes
  ```bash
